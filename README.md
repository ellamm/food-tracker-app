- 📊 **Calorie Calculation**: Automatic calorie computation from macros
- 📈 **Stats**: View total calories and macronutrient breakdown
- 📝 **Food Log**: History of all logged foods
- 📱 **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile
- 💾 **Local Storage**: Data persists between sessions
- 🎨 **Clean UI**: Simple, user-friendly interface

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Styling**: CSS3 with modern layouts
- **Storage**: Firebase
- **Deployment**: Netlify
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Add Food**: Enter food name and macronutrient values (carbs, protein, fat)
2. **Auto-Calculate**: App automatically calculates calories using standard macro-to-calorie conversions:
   - Carbohydrates: 4 calories per gram
   - Protein: 4 calories per gram
   - Fat: 9 calories per gram
3. **Track Progress**: View total calories and food log
4. **Persistent Data**: Your entries are saved in a firebase cloud storage

## 🎨 Design Principles

- **Simplicity**: Clean, uncluttered interface focusing on core functionality
- **Accessibility**: Proper form labels and semantic HTML
